# Applying-Machine-Learning-on-IOT-Data
In this tutorial, I am going to show you how to apply machine learning on data collected from your IoT endpoints , in our case it is nodemcu. In the previous tutorial, we already got data from nodemcu on google spreadsheet using google apps script api. We connected a temperatures sensor to nodemcu, and we were updating the data on the google spreadsheet.  We will be using jupyter notebook in this tutorial and write a python code that will predict the future temperature data based upon the data history we have.
